# Unfold Orbital Analyzer

A Python script to analyze orbital weights from unfolding calculations.

## Features
- Extract orbital weights for specific atoms and elements.
- Supports s, p, d, and f orbitals.
- Flexible selection of orbitals (e.g., `px`, `dxy`, `f5z^2-3r^2`).
- Output results to a `.dat` file.

## Installation
